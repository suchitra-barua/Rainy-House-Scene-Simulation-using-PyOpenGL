# Rainy-House-Scene-Simulation-using-PyOpenGL
This project simulates a rainy scene using PyOpenGL. It displays a house with falling raindrops and allows interaction via keyboard and mouse. Arrow keys change rain direction, and mouse clicks adjust background color. The goal is to visualize weather effects and practice interactive 2D graphics programming.
